USB-controlled function generator

Description:
This repo contains all the code and PCB designs related
to my USB-controlled function generator

It relies on an USB-enabled Atmel AVR at90usb162 microcontroller
and a DDS chip called ad9833. Together with some other components
the board can produce Sine, triangle and square wave output
from ~0.01Hz to ~3MHz. 

A simple GUI in the form of a python app allows for simple control 
of the hardware.

The current design doesn't allow for changing amplitude, offset,
coupling etc. That is planned to be implemented on a separate
board at a later date.


TODO:
* AVR: Complex FSK and PSK
* AVR: Implement commands to get current settings of the function generator
* PC:  Implement fetching current settings on startup of pc interface
